# AquaSpot 
AquaSpot is a Python- based software application that caters to the needs of Fishery researchers. This application's GUI is developed using PySide6. By analyzing factors such as the speed, distance from the port, and distance from the shore of the vessels,AquaSpot plots Fishing vessels and non Fishing vessels on map. Moreover, the application can also differentiate between various types of vessels and users can choose to plot speciLc vessel types on the map. To make use of AquaSpot, users can import their own data Files, which should contain essential information. Once the data is imported, AquaSpot examines the data and plots it on the map accordingly. AquaSpot allows users to download each plot as an HTML File, which makes the map interactive, allowing users to zoom in, zoom out, and pan across the map.
